# Step 3 - Configuration

The remainder of this wizard guides you through the process of configuring TrueBlocks. There are four components that must be configured. Most of them are probably already working. Two are optional. The components are:

- _Ethereum Node_,
- _Data API_ and _Backend Server_,
- _Node Scrapers_ (optional),
- _Sharing Server_ (optional)

We will consider each component seperately. The wizard will not proceed to the next step until the current step is completed. Once all of the components are properly configured, you may revisit their configuration settings by clicking the **Status Pills** at the top right hand corner of the screen.

We will begin with the most imporant component: the _Ethereum Node_.
