# Step 3a - Configuration - Ethereum Node

This section of the wizard will help you properly configure your Ethereum Node. You will not be able to proceed (i.e. the **NEXT** button will be disabled) until it is properly available.

We will consider each component seperately. TrueBlocks will not proceed to the next step until the current setup is resolved (i.e. the **NEXT** button will be disabled). Once all components are properly configured, you may revisit the setup by clicking on one of the four **Status Pills** at the top right of the screen.

## The Data API

1. Check to see if the **Data API** is running..._most likely it is._

   - If the API Pill at the top of the screen says `api: ok`...
   - and the `api`, `cache`, and `index` rows of the **OPTIONS** section of the **Status Panel** indicate values...
   - and the **Software Version** for TrueBlocks is presented...
   - and the **NEXT** button in the Navigation pane is lit...
   - Press the **NEXT** button.

2. If the **Data API** is not running properly, you won't be able to continue until it is (the **NEXT** button will be disabled).

If the **Data API** is not running, you will see red **Status Pills** at the top of the screen, the **Status** messages for both the Ethereum Node and TrueBlocks will be red, and you will see a large, red error message asking, `Is the API running?`. If any of these things are true, you must fix the configuration before proceeding.

## Action

When the Status Panel properly shows TrueBlocks' version number, press **NEXT** to proceed.
