# Step 2 - Getting Help

Before we proceed, let's look at the various ways to get help...

## Help Panel

To the right of the screen is the Help Panel. Whereever you are in the program, the help panel provides context sensitive help - short explanations of the current page with links to a deeper discussion. You may collapse the Help Panel by clicking on the Green question mark icon. Try it yourself.

## Social Icons

To the bottom right of the display are four social network icons: Twitter, GitHub, Medium, and Discord. You may, respectively, see what we've been tweeting about, submit an GitHub issue for TrueBlocks, read longer-form discussions about our work, and join in the technical conversation about TrueBlocks.

## The Support Menu Option

On the left side of the screen is the Main Menu. The last menu item, Support, gives you access to various Support options including free and for-pay support plans and licensing information.

## Action

Press the **NEXT** button to proceed to the next screen...
